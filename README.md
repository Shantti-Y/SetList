## Development Process

### 1. Design

Follow the royal road to design a website.

#### Wireframe

I would like to use a pen and a paper to write wireframes, because it can make prototypes in insanely fast speed.

#### Mockup

Used Adobe XD because it's free to use personally.

#### Application Architecture

Setlify doesn't need consistent data storage. My concept was to deploy this application as soon as possible.

### 2. Development

Mainly use JavaScript and its popular frameworks.

#### VS Code

For front-end development

#### React

In this application, there comes opportunities to change child components to another frequently. One of the most advantages of React is that React can swap component smoothly which Vue does same thing more difficult.
